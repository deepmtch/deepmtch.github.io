## The Problem with Tables in ChatGPT

ChatGPT is great for many things, but it doesn't handle formatted text well, especially tables. If you've ever tried to paste an Excel table into ChatGPT, you know it doesn't work smoothly.

## Enter the GPT Styler Tool

Our tool does two simple things:

1. Turns tables from Excel or Word into a format ChatGPT understands (called markdown)
2. Converts ChatGPT's markdown back into a format for Excel or Word

It's straightforward and free to use.

## How to Use It: Quick Steps

Here's how to use the tool:

### 1. Copy Your Table
