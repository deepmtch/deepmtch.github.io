        <h1>Effortless ChatGPT Integration on Mac: Zero Software Required</h1>
        <p>There are dozens of tools that help you use ChatGPT on your Mac, whether for translation, text correction,
            etc. But they all have one drawback: they either cost money or collect a lot of sensitive data before
            sending your data to OpenAI or any other provider.</p>
        <p>With this approach, you can simply send your text or whatever you want to be processed immediately to OpenAI,
            Mistral, or any other even open-source model.</p>

        <h2>How This Works?</h2>
        <p>We simply create a shortcut workflow that you can call in any application where you have text, notepad,
            browser, or anything else. You just right-click and your text is passed to the workflow, and the workflow
            will create the prompt and send it to OpenAI. The response will then replace your text. If you want only to
            analyze the text, say summarize, you can also do that by defining a separate workflow that has a simple
            prompt like “summarize the given text,” for example.</p>

        <h2>Here is How You Can Integrate OpenAI in Three Simple Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Import the Shortcut Workflow</strong><br>
                Download and click the the shortcut workflow from the link provided below and open it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add Your API Key and Customize the Prompt</strong><br>
                After importing the workflow, you will be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key. Make sure to replace
                "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key from OpenAI. You can also customize the prompt. The default
                prompt is set to rephrase text, but you can change it to "summarize the following text" or any other
                instruction you prefer.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Run from Anywhere</strong><br>
                Once your shortcut is set up, you can run it from any application. Highlight the text you want to
                process, right-click, select "Services", and choose your shortcut. The text will be sent to OpenAI and
                replaced with the response.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Screenshot: Calling the Shortcut</h3>
        <img src="/assets/img/howto-integrate-openai/screenshot-calling-shortcut.png" alt="Screenshot of Calling the Shortcut" style="width:50%;">

        <h3>Screenshot: Result of the Shortcut</h3>

        <p>You can do the same for other things like summarizing, translation, etc., by just replacing the prompt and
            creating appropriate keyboard shortcuts.</p>

        <h2>Creating Workflows for Other Tasks</h2>
        <p>Aside from rephrasing, you can create workflows for various tasks. For instance, to summarize text, create a
            new shortcut with the same steps but change the prompt to "summarize the following text". Similarly, you can
            set up workflows for translation by changing the prompt to "translate the following text to [language]". The
            possibilities are endless.</p>

        <h2>Customizing and Optimizing Your Workflow</h2>
        <p>To enhance your workflow, consider adding conditions and error handling. For example, if the API request
            fails, you can set a notification to alert you. You can also add different prompts based on user input,
            making your workflow versatile and adaptable to different needs.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Integrating ChatGPT or any other language model into your Mac workflow can greatly enhance your productivity.
            With a few simple steps, you can create a powerful tool that can rephrase, summarize, translate, and more,
            all without installing any additional software. Try it out and see how it can improve your daily tasks.</p>
