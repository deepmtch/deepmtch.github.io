## Step 2: Add Comparable Companies to Your Watchlist

Before making decisions based on absolute values and metrics, it's important to compare the stock with others in the same industry. Here's how to select appropriate comparables:

1. Identify the specific sub-sector or industry of your target stock (e.g., cloud infrastructure for Cloudflare)
2. Look for companies with similar business models, market cap, or target markets
3. Add these companies to your watchlist by clicking the flag icon next to each company name

For example, if you're interested in Cloudflare (NET), you might compare it with other cloud infrastructure providers like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Step 3: Compare Metrics in the Watchlist

Once you have added all the companies for comparison, go to your watchlist to view and compare the key metrics. This includes important financial indicators such as:

- Earnings Per Share (EPS): Indicates profitability on a per-share basis
- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Shows how expensive a stock is relative to its earnings
- Revenue Growth: Particularly important for tech companies, which often prioritize growth
- Gross Margin: Reflects the efficiency of the company's operations
- R&D Expenses: Indicates investment in future innovations
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio: Shows the company's financial leverage

## Customizing Your Screen

TradingView allows you to create custom screens based on your investment strategy. Consider factors like market capitalization, revenue growth rate, profitability metrics, and valuation ratios. Experiment with different combinations to find stocks that meet your specific criteria.

## Next Steps

After screening, it's crucial to conduct deeper research:

1. Analyze the company's financial statements
2. Study the industry trends and competitive landscape
3. Review recent news and analyst reports
4. Consider the company's management and corporate governance
