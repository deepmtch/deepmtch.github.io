# How to Easily Delete Browsing Data for a Single Website in Chrome

Chrome, for some reason, does not make it very easy to delete the browsing data for one website. But here is a small trick to do that without going through the jungle of the settings.


## Step 1: Open Chrome Settings

Open your browser and enter the following URL in the address bar:

`chrome://settings/content/all`

## Step 2: Select the Website

You will see a list of websites with stored data. Select the website you want to clear settings for.

## Step 3: Delete the Data

Hit the delete button (trash icon) beside the selected website.

That's it, done.

Happy browsing!
