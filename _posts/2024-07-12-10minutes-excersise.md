## The Magic Move: Bed to Badass in 60 Seconds

Here's the deal: The moment your eyes open, before your brain has a chance to come up with excuses, you're gonna:

1. Roll out of bed (literally, if you have to)
2. Stand up (congrats, hardest part done!)
3. Start jumping and swinging those arms

That's it. No water, no bathroom break, no checking your phone. Just pure, unadulterated, groggy movement.

## Why This Is Your New Morning BFF

* "But I'm tired" 😴
* "I'll do it later" ⏰
* "I need to check my emails first" 📱

You're already bouncing around like a happy kangaroo before your brain knows what hit it!
