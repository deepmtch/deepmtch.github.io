# Organize Your Chrome Tabs with This Simple Open-Source Extension
As a developer, I needed a straightforward way to organize my browser tabs without compromising on security or customizability. Unable to find an existing solution that met these criteria, I created Tab Sorter - an open-source Chrome extension designed for simplicity, security, and extensibility.

## Key Features

Tab Sorter offers three primary functions:

### 1. Sort Tabs by Domain

Automatically groups tabs from the same website together, ideal for research or multi-page browsing.

### 2. Group All Tabs

Allows you to group all tabs in the current window under a custom name, perfect for project organization.

### 3. Remove Duplicates

Identifies and closes exact duplicate tabs, with the option to review similar tabs before closing.


## Why Chrome Tab Sorter?

1. **Security**: As an open-source project, the code is transparent and can be audited by anyone.
2. **Simplicity**: Easy to use with a clean, straightforward interface.
3. **Extensibility**: Open-source nature allows for easy customization and community contributions.


## Extend It Yourself: The Beauty of Open Source

One of the greatest advantages of Tab Sorter being open-source is the ability for anyone to extend its functionality. Here's how you can do it:

1. Clone the GitHub repository
2. Examine the `background.js` and `popup.html` files
3. Use AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to help you understand and modify the code

For example, you could give the following prompt to an AI assistant:

"Here's the code for background.js and popup.html of my Chrome extension. I want to add a new feature that [describe your desired feature]. Can you show me how to modify the code to implement this?"

Then paste the contents of your `background.js` and `popup.html` files.

The AI can then provide suggestions on how to implement new features or modify existing ones. This approach allows even those with limited coding experience to experiment with and expand the extension's capabilities.

Remember, this is the beauty of open source - the power to customize and improve is in your hands!
