        <h1>Should Joe Biden Step Down? Opinions from ChatGPT, Mistral, and Claude</h1>
        <p>In this article, I explore whether President Joe Biden should step down, based on opinions from three AI models: ChatGPT, Mistral, and Claude. Given the current political climate and Biden's recent public appearances, this topic has generated much debate. Here, I share the perspectives of these models to see if there's a consensus or divergence in their views.</p>
        
        <h2>Context and Facts</h2>
        <p>Here are the facts provided to each AI model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incident in Vietnam (September 2023): During a press conference in Vietnam, President Joe Biden was cut off mid-sentence by his press secretary, leading to speculation about his ability to complete his statements and potential exhaustion.</li>
            <li>State of the Union Address (February 2023): President Biden made several gaffes and stumbled over words, leading to discussions about his verbal clarity and overall communication skills.</li>
            <li>Event in Israel (October 2023): While addressing an audience in Israel, Biden appeared to lose his train of thought and struggled to articulate his points.</li>
            <li>NATO Summit in Lithuania (July 2023): During the NATO summit, President Biden misspoke multiple times and needed assistance from aides to clarify his statements.</li>
            <li>Next U.S. Presidential Election: The next U.S. presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.</li>
            <li>Joe Bidenâ€™s Opponents in the 2024 Election: Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Mike Pence, Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Marianne Williamson.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given these facts, I asked each AI model to make a recommendation on whether President Joe Biden should step down or continue his presidency. Below are the results.</p>

        <h2>ChatGPT's Opinion</h2>
        <p><strong>Option 1: Step Down</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Option 2: Not Step Down</strong></p>
        <img src="/assets/img/should-biden-step-down/chatgpt_not_step_down.png" alt="ChatGPT Not Step Down Recommendation">
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>

        <h2>Claude's Opinion</h2>
        <p><strong>Option 1: Not Step Down (70%)</strong></p>
        <img src="/assets/img/should-biden-step-down/claude_not_step_down.png" alt="Claude Not Step Down Recommendation">
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
        <img src="/assets/img/should-biden-step-down/claude_recommendation.png" alt="Claude Recommendation">

        <h2>Mistral's Opinion</h2>
        <p><strong>Option 1: Step Down (60%)</strong></p>
        <img src="/assets/img/should-biden-step-down/mistral_step_down.png" alt="Mistral Step Down Recommendation">
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong></p>
        <img src="/assets/img/should-biden-step-down/mistral_recommendation.png" alt="Mistral Recommendation">

        <h2>Remarks</h2>
        <p>I asked all models multiple times, and the answers were consistent. Claude is strongly convinced that Biden should remain in office, while ChatGPT and Mistral have different opinions. This experiment reveals potential biases and perspectives of each model, offering an eye-opener to the gray zones we might not be aware of.</p>
        <p>It is also interesting to consider the role each language model might be taking: the average U.S. citizen, a politician, or maybe even a non-U.S. citizen.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer: I have a personal opinion which I won't share here. This article is more tech-driven than real political science. Feel free to try this experiment yourself and share your ideas.</p>
        <p>Happy prompting!</p>
