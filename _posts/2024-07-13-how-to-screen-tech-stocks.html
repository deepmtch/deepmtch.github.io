        <h1>How to Screen Tech Stocks in 3 Steps</h1>
        <p>There are thousands of guidelines and tools on how to do stock screening, but you might be overwhelmed with the amount of information. In this super short tutorial, I will show you how to find interesting stocks and compare them using a few simple tools for free.</p>
        <p>TradingView is one of the leading platforms for trading charts and I love how intuitive it is. I use the free plan and with this plan you can actually do quite a lot.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Navigate to the TradingView Stock Screener</h2>
        <p>Start by visiting the TradingView stock screener at <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/screener/" target="_blank">https://www.tradingview.com/screener/</a>. This tool allows you to filter stocks based on various criteria. For this tutorial, let's say we are interested in Cloudflare (NET).</p>
        <p>Select the market and sector relevant to your search. For Cloudflare, you would choose the technology sector.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Add Comparable Companies to Your Watchlist</h2>
        <p>Before making decisions based on absolute values and metrics, it is advisable to compare the stock with others in the same industry. For instance, Cloudflare can be compared with Amazon AWS, Google, etc., which also provide cloud infrastructure.</p>
        <p>To do this, select a few companies to compare Cloudflare with by clicking the flag icon next to each company name. This will add them to your watchlist.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Compare Metrics in the Watchlist</h2>
        <p>Once you have added all the companies for comparison, go to your watchlist to view and compare the key metrics. This includes metrics such as EPS, valuation, dividends, profitability, and other important financial indicators.</p>

        <p>Now you can look and compare all interesting metrics like EPS, valuation, dividends, and profitability from the marked menu bar.</p>

        <p>At this stage, you can analyze and compare various metrics. Understanding which metrics to look at is crucial, and while this tutorial does not cover all the details, you can find plenty of resources online for guidance.</p>
        <p>By following these three simple steps, you can effectively screen and compare tech stocks to make well-informed investment decisions.</p>
