# The Easiest Way to Handle WebP Images: Just Rename to JPG

Many internet users have been frustrated by images saving as WebP files when they'd prefer the more familiar JPG format. Good news: there's an incredibly simple solution that works in any browser.

## The One-Step Solution: Just Rename the File

Here's all you need to do:

1. Save the image as WebP (don't change anything in the save dialog)
2. After it's saved, simply rename the file extension from .webp to .jpg

That's it! No need to change settings in the save dialog or use any special tools.

## Why This Works

WebP is a container format that often stores image data in a way that's compatible with JPEG. When you rename a WebP file to .jpg, you're telling your computer to treat the image as a JPEG file. Most image viewing and editing tools can then open and work with the file without issues.

## Important Notes

- This method works with any browser - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, or others.
- It works for most WebP images, though some complex ones might not be fully compatible.
- You can also try renaming to other extensions like .png if you prefer.
